You can perform simple maths within linux script using something like

echo $(( 10 + 10 ))

the numbers can be replaced with variables like this

number1=10

- you can test that with echo $number1

number2=20

- sets the second variable
 
number3=$(($number2 + $number2))

- creates the answer as variable $number3 which can be tested with 

echo $number3
